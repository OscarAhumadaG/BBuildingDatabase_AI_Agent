# Building Your Own Database Agent

This repository contains the project **Building Your Own Database Agent**, which I completed as part of a mini-project provided by Microsoft and DeepLearning.AI. The project involved creating a custom database agent using AI techniques, and this repository showcases the implementation and outcomes.

## Project Overview

The **Building Your Own Database Agent** project focuses on constructing an intelligent agent capable of interacting with a database autonomously. The agent is designed to handle various database operations, leveraging AI to optimize performance and accuracy.

## Features

- **Automated Query Generation**: The agent can generate SQL queries based on natural language input.
- **Database Interaction**: The agent connects to a database, executes queries, and retrieves results.
- **AI-Driven Optimization**: AI techniques are applied to optimize query performance and accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the agent.
- **SQL**: Used for interacting with the database.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Leveraged for query optimization and natural language processing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for developing and testing the agent.
